The script should read/get information one of the following (you can use multiple, but do not need to):

The script should have at least one each of the following flow control elements:
- for or while loop
- if statement

You must define and use at least two functions

You must import at least one module (e.g., os, re, argparse, numpy, pandas, etc.)

Test data will have 10 different individuals each with their own (not necessarily unique identifier). The program will take a random individual as a starting seed. Then it will test pairing with every single individual and return the top 3 based on scoring. Then it will continue down the list of remaining individuals again choosing a random starting seed then testing pairing with every single unpaired individual and returning the top 3 based on scoring. This is kind of a factorial type thing. At the end the program will compare the sum of the compatibility scores to see where it gets the highest pairing and choose the top 3 sets and return those as results.
The program will have a given data set that it will be comparing to which returns on compatibility score based on the scoring. The program will try to maximize the sum of the compatibility score.
